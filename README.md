# rust-hello-world

This project is a testing repo for publishing Rust packages to various package registries and ecosystems.

The primary objective is to understand the processes, requirements, procedures, and potential obstacles when publishing
Rust packages to repositories such as Crates.io, Github, Docker Hub, Winget, Debian and others.

This experimentation will provide invaluable insights into cross-platform Rust development and deployment.

Please note that this is strictly for testing purposes.
